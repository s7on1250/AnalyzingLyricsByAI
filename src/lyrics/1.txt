Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youth
I do recall, those were the best times, most of all
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burnin' love comes once in a lifetime
She found me singing by the rail road track
Took me home, we danced by moonlight

Those summer nights are callin',
Stone in love
Can't help myself I'm fallin'
Stone in love

Old dusty roads, led to the river
Runnin' slow
She pulled me down, and in clover
We'd go 'round
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burnin' love comes once in a lifetime
Oh the memories never fade away
Golden girl, I'll keep you forever.

Those summer nights are callin',
Stone in love
Can't help myself I'm fallin'
Stone in love
